    "## Methodology\n",
    "To answer this research question, I will first analyze the growth of the technology sector over time\n",
    "from 2012 to 2021. This will give me a baseline to be able to compare the growth (or decline of\n",
    "other industries). I will then aggregate the top 5 - 10 sectors in Seattle (since using all of them\n",
    "would be difficult to analyze) and to compare to the growth of the technology sector. I will also\n",
    "split this growth by zipcodes to see how the top 5 - 10 sectors have changed over time since different\n",
    "areas of Seattle are more dominant in different job sectors. All of this will give a bigger picture\n",
    "to how the technology industry has affected other job sectors from 2012 to 2021."
